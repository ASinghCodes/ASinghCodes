-  Hi, I’m Amanjit Singh
-  After lots of stress I had managed to get my old github account back only to realize my professors had removed me from the class repos access, thus I decided to start a brand new github filled with original projects rather than school projects.
-  Please be patient with me as I upload my ongoing projects here!
-  You can reach me at a.singh.uh@gmail.com for any professional or business inquiries!

ASinghCodes/ASinghCodes is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
